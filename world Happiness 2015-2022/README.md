## Insights

Here are some insights from the data:

- **Which value is the most important for measuring world happiness?** As we can see in these scatter plot charts all the value has positive correlation but that varies from strong to weak. Family, health and economy have very strong correlation with more than 0.86 coefficient. Freedom has strong correlation with 0.78 coefficient. Trust has moderate correlation with 0.46 coefficient. Generosity has weak correlation with 0.33 coefficient. Based on this correlation, we can conclude that family, health, economy, and freedom are important values that contribute the most for the word happiness.
- **Determine which year had the highest and lowest happiness scores?** From the sum chart, we can see that the difference in happiness score over the years does not vary much. The trend line is negative, especially this last three year where the score are declining. The difference between the highest score (2015) and the lowest score (2022) is only 40 points. From the average chart, we can see that the highest score is in 2022 and the lowest is in 2017. The trend line is positive, and in the last five years the average score has increasing.
- **Identify the continent and region with the happiest people and provide the top 3 and bottom 3 countries in terms of happiness?** The continent with the happiest people is Europe, with 29.96% followed by Asia with 28.57%. The region with the happiest people is western Asia. The 3 countries with the highest happiness scores are Finland, Denmark and Switzerland.
